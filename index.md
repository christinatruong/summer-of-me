###Day 2 - June 22, 2014

I was planning to just update the styles for this page for today's project but that wasn't much of an "experiment" since I was just writing some basic CSS.  Instead, I decided to finally give [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) a try.

I spent more than 30 minutes on this today but I'm not exactly sure how long since I took a dinner break but I'd say maybe about an hour or so.  It was actually pretty easy to set up and probably shouldn't even take that long to get it up and running but I was dilly-dallying a bit.

With Jekyll, I can now create templates and includes without using PHP and I can continue to use Markdown without manually exporting the files to HTML. Between using this and [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/), pretty much everything is automatic!

###Day 5 - June 25, 2014

I've learned a valuable lesson about making excuses because when I woke up today, I actually felt bad about skipping yesterday. Disappointed even. I chose 30 minutes a day to make it an achievable task.  I'm sure I spent 30 minutes yesterday on some bullshit activity so it would have been really easy for me to do this but it was 11:15pm and I told myself that I was tired and this was supposed to be fun, not a chore.  Then, I ended up tossing and turning and not getting a good sleep anyway.

Yes, this was supposed to be fun but maybe more importantly, this is a goal I'm trying to achieve and missing the mark so early actually makes me feel a little crappy but what's done is done. No more excuses.

This will be updated later with today's project! No more excuses!
