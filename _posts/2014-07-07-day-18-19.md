The last two days have been kind of hectic so yesterday and today, I'm just going to keep 
reading [JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development](http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/javascript-and-jquery-interactive-front/9781118531648-item.html) by Jon Duckett as my daily project!

Also, I just realized I didn't upload the final css file for my balloon animations either so check it out again to see smoother animations: [http://christinatruong.github.io/summer-of-me/projects/day-16.html](http://christinatruong.github.io/summer-of-me/projects/day-16.html)
