title: Day 35 to 39 - Updates + 1 CSS trick, attribute selectors!
published: true

---

It's been pretty crazy this week so I've just been doing some "easy" #summerofme updates.  I fixed some responsive bugs on the site and did some reading.  Keeping it simple.  But I feel like I should share something.  So here's a little CSS trick for reducing class names.  How many of you have done this before?

```
<button class="btn btn-blue">Click me!</button>
<button class="btn btn-green">Click me!</button>
```
```
.btn {
  //shared styles
}
.btn-blue {
  //specific styles
}
.btn-green {
  //specific styles
}
```

BUT, if you use an attribute selector combined with an asterisk, `[attribute*=value]`, it will match every element with the attribute value containing the specified value. The asterisk is a **univeral selector**. So the above can be changed to:

```
<button class="btn-blue">Click me!</button>
<button class="btn-green">Click me!</button>
```
```
[class*="btn-"] {
  //shared styles
}
.btn-blue {
  //specific styles
}
.btn-green {
  //specific styles
}
```
No more extra class! But to be safe, one more selector should be added. The caret symbol. It's used in regular expressions to designate the beginning of a string. What if your HTML looked like this?

```
<button class="some-class button-blue">Click me!</button>
<button class="button-green">Click me!</button>
```
The current selector won't recognize the `btn-blue` because of the space between the classes.  Update the selector to add another attribute selector, with the caret symbol.

```
[class*="btn-"],
[class^=" btn-"] {
  //shared styles
}
.btn-blue {
  //specific styles
}
.btn-green {
  //specific styles
}
```

Ta da!

I wish I could take credit for being clever but I found this by digging through the [Bootstrap](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048) framework files :)
