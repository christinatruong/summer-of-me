I've finally finished this blog post that I've been working on for a long time. I'm going to be doing a talk about diversity (or should I say lack of diversity) in tech in August and I wanted this to be a precursor to the talk.  It took so long to write because it is a personal topic for me.

Here's the link: [https://medium.com/p/5cba33911416](https://medium.com/p/5cba33911416)

I hope you enjoy it!
