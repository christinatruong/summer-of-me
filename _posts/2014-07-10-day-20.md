title: Day 20 - Refactoring & Sass Mixins
published: true
---

I'm revisiting my animated balloons and converting all of the redundant CSS to mixins and also using the @for directive to loop through the mixins and classes so I can create different styles for the balloons without physically writing "balloon-1, balloon-2, etc".  It's not ready yet so I don't want to post it yet but hopefully it'll be done tomorrow.
