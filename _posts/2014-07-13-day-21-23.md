Still tweaking the animated balloons and just realized it doesn't work on Firefox :(  I'm also working on a blog post about diversity in tech as a precursor to the talk I'm going to give at the [Distill Conference](https://distill.engineyard.com/) in August.

Tickets are still available, by the way. Contact me at hello@christinatruong.com if you're interested in attending. I have a friends & family discount!
