title: Day 11 - Processing Fireworks
published: true

---

<p>I had this grand idea to make some fireworks since today is Canada Day and all.  I found a Processing sketch and ended up not making too many changes from the original.  I changed the speed, some colours and the size of the dots of the fireworks.  You can see the original sketch url in the source code.</p>
