<p>I wanted to do something with canvas but these boxes was pretty much as far as I got since I didn't have much time today and I think I'll need more than 30mins for this :(</p>

<canvas id="canvas" width="150" height="100"></canvas>
<script type="text/javascript">
function draw() {
  var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
  if (canvas.getContext) {
    var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

    ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(200,0,0)";
    ctx.fillRect (10, 10, 55, 50);

    ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 200, 0.5)";
    ctx.fillRect (30, 30, 55, 50);
  }
}

draw();
</script>

<p>So instead, I rearranged the homepage again and fixed a few mobile bugs. Also, check out my <a href="/summer-of-me/2014/06/29/day-9.html">Day 9 project again (CSS Shapes/Illustrations)</a> if you want to see the individual shapes that I created to make the whole face.</p>
<p>That's all I got! Good night!</p>
