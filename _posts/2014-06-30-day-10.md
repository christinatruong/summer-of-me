title: Day 9 - iPhone & Safari's Develop Menu
published: true
---

Today I was going to tackle some of the mobile bugs of this site but I don't really feel like it cause me and the hubby are watching American Ninja Warrior. Yep.

Instead, I'm going to show a video of how to enable Safari's Develop Menu and use the browser's dev tools to inspect what's on your iPhone's browser. I first saw this from fellow #summerofme comrade, [Pearl Chen](http://pchen.github.io/summer-of-me/) and was so excited. You can minimize and maximize the browser all you want but it's not the same as seeing it an actual device.


First, enable Safariâ€™s Develop Menu.

* Open Safari and select **Safari** > **Preferences** from the menu.
* Select the **Advanced** tab and check **Show Develop menu in menu bar**.


Then, open a web page in Safari on the iPhone.  Select **Develop** in the menu and the webpage that's open on the phone will show.

Select it and the Web Inspector opens!

Check it out in action below.
