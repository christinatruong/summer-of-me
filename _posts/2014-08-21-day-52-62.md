So, it's been crazy the few weeks. The Distill Conference is all wrapped up, though I'm waiting for them to post the videos of the talks because my slides make absolutely no sense without hearing what I'm saying!  The new Ladies Learning Code CSS workshop is also all done though I need to tweak the content since it ran way too long.  

Speaking of which, I decided to use the final project, an HTML resume, and post my own as my #summerofme project because why not? I was using it as a base as I was creating the workshop already, then made a generic version for the participants.

So here it is: [http://christinatruong.com/resume](http://christinatruong.com/resume)

Oh, unrelated but did you know that you can use Emmet shortcuts in JSFiddle?!
