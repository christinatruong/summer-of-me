title: Day 24 - 26 - Sublime Text tricks!
published: true

I'm still working on the same blog post and it will definitely take a little longer so I have another blog post for today! As someone who is constantly changing class and variable names, *after* I've written a bunch of code, I've found the **Find in Files** feature in Sublime Text to be a lifesaver.

For example, I'll create Sass variables in a partial file and then use the variables in other partial files. Then change my mind. Find in files allows me to search and replace across multiple files.

1. Select Find in Files to open the panel.

2. Enter the phrase you want to change. Then select the ellipsis (...) button.

3. Add the folder containing the files that need to be updated.

4. Add the phrase you want to change to & select Replace!
![](/summer-of-me/img/find-in-files-4.png)
![](/summer-of-me/img/find-in-files-5.png)

The affected files will automatically open in the editor and if you're satisfied with the changes, then just save it!
